# Patrick's GPU / Jupyter / Tensorflow (And PyTorch) Stuff

## Welcome

* Welcome to Patrick's GPU, Jupyter, Tensorflow and Pytorch stuff experimental repo. This is where I put a bunch of stuff that I use to work with GPU's, language models and what not in a Jupyter environment.
* Originally I started this so I could get my old GeForce 1070 GPU working on an old computer and run language models and other fun AI stuff.

## Where To Go

* To get started, go to:

* [README-BOOT](README/README-BOOT.md) for information on how to boot up the Docker container, Jupyter notebook, and installation of dependencies both prior to and after launching the container.
* Note the section on Torch and Non-Anaconda requirements and how to get torch installed.

* [README-](README/TODO.md) for a general to-do list of stuff I might or might not be working on.
