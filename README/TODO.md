# TODO LIST

* MLOPS: Install sklearn via conda in image
* MLOPS: Install matplotlib via conda in image

* DS: Create PCA/Kmeans analysis preserving market_id information.
* DS: Output CLUSTER and MARKET_TITLE to a huge dict list which we can use to train an LLM
* DS: Hook up falcon7GB to notebook, run it
* DS: Train falcon7GB on notebook, with a very small dataset, maybe 10 or so entries.
* DS: After evaluating the above short trained LLM, go for a larger training set.
* DS: Test using fine-tuned LLM with prompt to try to qualify/predict an incoming market by CLUSTER
* DS: Explore dealing with sparce data, e.g. convert feature from dense to sparce maybe to improve/tweak if needed

* DS: Market volatility tool
* DS: Market volatility by cluster
